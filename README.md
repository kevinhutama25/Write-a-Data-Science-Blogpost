2. What kind of Education do they have? - _This is to answer should I go back into college or potentially get a higher degree to get into the field_
3. What other method are popular do these professionals take? - _In my country, data science bootcamp is very popular, however, given the huge amount of money I should pay, this is not the first option to get into the field, but, if most people happens to have experience the bootcamp, I might look into it._
4. What's the most used programming language among Data Scientists and Data Analysts? - _This is to determine what kind of programming language should I focus on, between Python and R_
5. How's the average and median salary of these professions? - _I also want to know if i ever going to apply for these kind of job, these information would be my basis to negotiate the salary_
