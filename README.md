I am an aspiring Data Scientist, I switch career from a salesperson to a business analysts and currently lookig for a way to become an advanced data analysts or data scientists
My initial analysis here is to find out about:
**1. How many users are working as a Data Scientists, Data Analysts, or Business Analysts?**

It turns out only a few respondent worked as these professions, Data Scientists or Machine learning Specialist only 2.6% of total respondent while Data or Business Analysts only 1.3%

**2. What kind of Education do they have? - _This is to answer should I go back into college or potentially get a higher degree to get into the field_**

More than 40% of total respondent who worked as Data Scientists, Data Analysts or Business Analysts have a Master Degree, and around 35% of them have at least a Bacehlor's Degree.

**3. What other method are popular do these professionals take? - _In my country, data science bootcamp is very popular, however, given the huge amount of money I should pay, this is not the first option to get into the field, but, if most people happens to have experience with the bootcamp, I might look into it._**

Luckily only a few have experiences in Coding Bootcamp with a total of 2.6% from total respondent, outside school, Online courses or certification is probably one of the popular way to learn the skills.

**4. What's the most used programming language among Data Scientists and Data Analysts? - _This is to determine what kind of programming language should I focus on, between Python and R_**

It seems that Python and SQL is the most popular language that currently people use to work with, I might need to get an online course in the field of Python

**6. How's the average and median salary of these professions? - _I also want to know if i ever going to apply for these kind of job, these information would be my basis to negotiate the salary_**

Data Scientists have more yearly salary compared to Data/Business Analysts with almost 10K difference on average and 8K difference if we compare the median.
